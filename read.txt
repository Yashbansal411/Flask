 This readme is for implement kurento-one2one call on GS Lab openstack server.
                                                            I use Ubuntu 18.04 and all the steps written below is for that only.

Step 1. Create a instace in server(you raise request in pulse and openstack team will help you)
        
        They have to create a account in server and provide credentials of your account.
        Then they provide a doc in which all the steps are written to create a instace and activate as well.

Step 2. After the creation of instance you got a floating IP.

Initially I am facing an issue in accessing the server and how to run my code in server, For same Issue follow those steps 

Step 1. To enter in server use ssh command 
        command "sudo ssh -i (name of .pem file you got from openstack team) ubuntu@(floating ip of your instance)"

To run the  application on the server please following steps 

Step 1. clone this git 
step 2. Now follow the document and install Kurento on the server - https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/6.10.0/user/installation.html

step 3. Move to kurento-one2one-call by using cd command

Step 4. Now run command "mvn -U clean spring-boot:run" for the execution
